		<h1>Flipping the Switch on Fear</h1>
		<p>You know that feeling . . . you want something to go well, but you’re just not sure you’ll see the outcome you so deeply desire. You’re worried, uncertain, nervous . . . and you tell a friend, husband, or someone about your angst; and what is their response?</p>
		
		<p>They encourage you to calm yourself.</p>

		<p>This well-intentioned advice seems logical and practical. But the fact is . . . it does absolutely no good whatsoever because it’s not how we’re wired. The body cannot quickly downgrade from a state of high angst to “calm.” It’s too much of a giant, impractical leap. Amy Cuddy shares the biology around this and asks, “Rather than fruitlessly trying to change the arousal level of our emotional states from high to low, what if we try to change them from negative to positive? From anxiety to excitement?”</p>

		<p>For example, as experienced as I am, and as silly as it sounds, I still get anxious when I speak. But I have learned to redirect the anxiety by thinking about “why” I was giving the talk in the first place. As I do this, my eagerness around my “why” and the subject matter grows, and I cannot help to feel increasing excitement (rather than the fear) to share these ideas with others. This little mind game (which I now know was just me focusing on my “why”) enables my anxieties and fears to dissipate so I can truly bring my authentic self to others.</p>

		<p>Ladies, when we are focused on our “why” and when that “why” is about others, we will naturally make decisions and take actions that will lead to the results we so deeply desire, and then find ourselves excited about all the good things that can happen, rather than finding ourselves filled with angst.</p>

		<p>As we come toward the end of this season, would you try something with me? Today or tomorrow, just take a solid 5-10 minutes to write down all the reasons why you love cabi.</p>


		<p>Now think about your excitement to share those things with others. Stay focused on your “why” as you wear those beautiful clothes, do a couple more shows, and propose.</p>

		<p>May this final month of the season be filled with opportunities for others to see your cabi excitement!</p>

		<p>Committed to you,</p>

		<p>Kimberly</p>

		<h1>Finishing Fall Strong</h1>
		<h2>A Special Message (&amp; a BIG Announcement) from Lynne</h2>
		<p>As we head into the last few weeks of selling fall, Lynne filmed this special message that we posted to currently cabi on Tuesday, December 5, giving a quick inventory update and encouraging Stylists to finish strong. As cabi girls shared how they’re all-in to finish strong, we heard suggestions of extending free shipping all the way until December 31. So, in true partnership with all of you, Lynne has decided to extend our free shipping on retail orders AND Buy One, Give 2 for the rest of the season. Cheers to finishing strong, cabi girls!</p>

		<h1>Starting Spring Smart</h1>
		<!--sections with many h2 or h3 headers should also likely have accoridians in them-->
		<h2>Ordering Your Spring ’18 Marketing Materials</h2>
		<h3>Invitations &amp; Postcards</h3>
		<p>Beginning Monday, December 11, you may place orders for your Spring ’18 Invitations and postcards, and these will begin shipping on Wednesday, December 13 (within our 10-13 business day shipping window). Get your February Hostesses and guests excited by sending out the Invitations now to build anticipation! And, to help ensure you’re buying only what you need, we’re now selling our envelopes separate from our Invitations and postcards.</p>
		
		<h3>Notions &amp; Look Books</h3>
		<p>Although these materials won’t head your way until after The Scoop, you can begin ordering these two items on Tuesday, January 9, and if you order by 7:00 a.m. Pacific on Monday, January 15, you’ll have a target arrival date of Monday, January 22. While you’re placing your order, make sure to order these two materials separately from your Fashion Flash orders or any other supplies, as we will hold these orders until The Scoop.</p>
		
		<h3>New Hostess Gifts &amp; Supplies</h3>
		<p>We’ll have two new Hostess gifts and one new supply item available for purchase at The Scoop Shopping Event.</p>
		<h2>Seasonal Inventory Details</h2>
		<h3>Tax &amp; Shipping</h3>
		<!-- this is like a faq text group -->
		<p>Paid by credit card?</p>
		<p>Look for your tax and shipping to be charged within two weeks of The Scoop. Our Shipping Team packs and ships these pieces as early as 2 weeks before The Scoop, although both won’t officially be charged until your Inventory ships.</p>
		<p>Paid by Gift Card or ACH?</p>
		<p>You’ll see your tax and shipping charged when your Inventory ships in January.</p>
		<p>Need to double-check or change your payment method?</p>
		<p>Go to “Seasonal Inventory Payments” under “My Account” in CLIO. If you wish to change your payment method, be sure to do so at least 3 business days before the payment is due.</p>
		<p>Hoping to defer your payment?</p>
		<p>In our Week 12 cabi Connection, we shared you have the option to defer your Seasonal Inventory payment after you renew, but this choice was mistakenly missing in CLIO. We’ve made this correction, so you may now choose to defer your Spring ’18 Seasonal Inventory payment under “My Account,” and “Seasonal Inventory Payment.” If you’d like to defer, be sure to do so before Wednesday, January 24, 2018.</p>

		<h2>It’s Nearly Time to Re-Install CLIO GO</h2>
		<p>As part of keeping our CLIO GO app secure, Apple requires an annual security redistribution, and ours is happening on December 13! So, if you’re using CLIO GO on an iPhone or iPad, you will need to re-install the app on or after December 13, or you won’t be able to use it at your next show.</p>
